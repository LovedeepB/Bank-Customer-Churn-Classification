# Churn Classification 
Below is the abstract portion of the research paper that goes along with this analysis. It tells you what my goal was and what the outcome of my research was. 

## Abstract 
A pipeline allows you to have a true workflow and that was what I wanted to achieve with this project. The stage of the pipeline that I was mostly focused on was the estimator stage. There are many different classification techniques that I can use, and I wanted to see which one yielded me the best results. Once I had figured that out, I tuned that machine learning technique to make the pipeline perform even better. The dataset that was used in this project is telling you whether an individual is/was a customer of the bank. To help classify the individuals there are 22 features that are given with the dataset. Some of the features are the customers age, gender, dependent count, education level, marital status, income category, card category, and many more. The results that I obtained after my research was that for this dataset using a bagging classifier was the best estimator for the pipeline.
